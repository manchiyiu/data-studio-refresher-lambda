# Data Studio Refresher Lambda

This is a ready-to-deploy lambda that can refresh a Google Data Studio dashboard. By using Cloudwatch events to schedule the lambda, one can achieve auto-refreshing for Google Data Studio.

It is forked from [puppeteer-lambda-starter-kit](https://github.com/sambaiz/puppeteer-lambda-starter-kit).

## Instructions

To add a new lambda for auto-refreshing a Google Data Studio Dashboard, please:

- Create a Google account who is the editor for the dashboard;

- Create a new `serverless.config.<dashboard-name>.yml` (clone from `serverless.config.template.yml`) in this directory. Fill in the dashboard URL, the schedule cron expression and the username, password and recovery email (in case Google rejected the login) for the account.

- Run the following commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn global add serverless
sls deploy --name <dashboard-name> --stage prod
```

- To remove the lambda when it's no longer needed:

```
sls remove --name <dashboard-name> --stage prod
```
